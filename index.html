<P><B>What I see myself doing 10 years from now.<//B><BR>
<P>The way I see myself ten years ahead of now is something I often think about. One thing I am certain of, is that if ALLAH gives me the opportunity to do something new, I will put all of my efforts to become a successful and a confident girl. We all have goals that we strive to achieve. Goals make our lives exciting. Without them, life would be meaningless, with no purpose and with no sense of direction. They make us rise up every morning to pursue them. With a ten year plane, I work each day to ensure that my goals see the light of day. </P>
